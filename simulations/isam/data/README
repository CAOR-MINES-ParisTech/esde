Short summary of the datasets

File formats:

Various file formats are parsed by iSAM. Note that often encountered
variable initialization entries (eg. VERTEX) are not supported, as in
online settings only the measurements are available, and the
initialization has to be obtained from the measurements. Also, the
measurements must be in time order as actually obtained by the robot.
All measurement entries follow the same convention:

NAME id1 id2 measurement_1...measurement_n sqrtinf_1...sqrtinf_n

where sqrtinf_i is the i-th entry of the upper triangular square root
of the information matrix in row-first order (eg. sxx sxy sxt syy syt
stt). Note that for 3D poses the angles and corresponding sqrtinf
entries are in the order: roll-pitch-yaw.

The groundtruth directory contains the original trajectory for some of
the datasets, before noise has been added.
